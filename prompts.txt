# AI Tool Used: ChatGPT
# Purpose: Enhancement of Wrangler core library to support ByteSize and TimeDuration unit parsing and aggregation

## Prompts Used

1. "Guide me"  
   → Used to outline an approach to the Wrangler enhancement assignment and break down the requirements into actionable phases.

2. "do"  
   → Requested execution of Phase 7, specifically README and prompts.txt generation.

3. "Where to add this"  
   → Asked for precise placement of new feature documentation in README.md.

4. "change origin command github"  
   → Help with updating git remote origin to point to personal GitHub fork.

5. "What to do after Phase 7"  
   → Guidance on final deliverables, testing, and assignment submission.

6. "5. AI Tools Usage..."  
   → Clarified how to properly fulfill the AI tooling documentation requirement.

## Additional Prompts (used or paraphrased)

- "ANTLR lexer rule for BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION units"
- "How to parse values like '10MB' and '150ms' into canonical units in Java"
- "Implement a custom aggregation directive in Wrangler using Directive interface"
- "How to accumulate state using ExecutorContext in Wrangler"
- "Generate unit tests for parsing and aggregation logic in Wrangler"
- "Java conversion logic for handling KB, MB, GB, and ms, s, min"

## Notes

- ChatGPT was used as a pair-programming assistant for architecture planning, parser rule design, test scaffolding, and documentation drafting.
- Final implementation, debugging, and tests were reviewed and iterated manually.
- IntelliJ IDEA was used as the primary IDE; all build and test verification done using `mvn clean install`.
